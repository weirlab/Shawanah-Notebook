January 13, 2020: Making FASTA Files:
#Code run: Pending

#Running on the node:
ssh USER6@192.168.0.5 #change the username to match your user number

#It will ask for a password, which is the same as your main password for the lab server. This is the login for the node called "Ramphocelus", so the command should now show "USER#@Ramphocelus. There are a few other nodes with different IP addresses, make sure that you are logged into the node you were assigned to because your work will not show up on other nodes.

When you are working in the node, the main server is accessible as /hhome/, so any commands you want to run on files stored on the main server you will need to change any mentions of /home/ to /hhome/, but in general we do not want to do that because it is slower to access those files from the nodes.

#Creating FASTA Files:
#Define some variables, change them for your species
GENOME="MGWA_VELO045" #for example, "FOSP_JTW4086", the name of your folder in 0_BIOD98_GENOMES1
ASSEMBLY_Date="29Nov2019" #for example, 22Nov2019, the date you used when you ran supernova (NOT the current date!)

#make a new folder, do not need to change anything but the variables above need to be defined first
mkdir /hhome/0_BIOD98_GENOMES2/"$GENOME"/"$GENOME"__29Nov2019__750mill/FASTAOUTPUT

#run supernova mkoutput, do not need to change anything
/home/0_PROGRAMS/supernova-2.1.1/supernova mkoutput --style=pseudohap --asmdir=/hhome/0_BIOD98_GENOMES2/"$GENOME"/"$GENOME"__29Nov2019__750mill/outs/assembly --outprefix=/hhome/0_BIOD98_GENOMES2/"$GENOME"/"$GENOME"__29Nov2019__750mill/FASTAOUTPUT/"$GENOME" --minsize=1000 --headers=short
